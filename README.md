# HonestCalculator

## About
The International Union Against Idleness (IUAI) announced a competition for an application that would motivate users. There are prizes involved. Since you like competing and know a little bit about programming, you asked your friend to prepare an interesting algorithm for a quick buck. Unfortunately, you weren't clear enough, and instead of a ready-made program, a friend prepared a flowchart of Honest Calculator. You will have to put some effort into assembling it.

## Learning outcomes
Learn how to read flowcharts to hone your understanding of loops, conditions, and algorithms. It will allow you to write your own algorithms. This skill also prevents multiple changes from occurring during production.

## Stages:
### :white_check_mark:Stage 1/5: Data Collection
Collect data and check if users were attentive in school.
### :white_check_mark:Stage 2/5: First Calculations
Perform the first calculations and check if users know how to handle zero.
### :white_check_mark:Stage 3/5: Total Recall
Sometimes the numbers are so big that you have to store them. Implement this feature!
### :white_check_mark:Stage 4/5: The Laziness Test
Now, it is time to tell users what the calculator thinks about equations.
### :white_check_mark:Stage 5/5: Saving Memory
Electricity costs money, the processor overheats, the memory fills up, so you have to watch what users want to store.
